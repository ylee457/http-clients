Cows and other livestock emit huge quantities of <strong>methane, which is <a href=\"https://www.edf.org/methane-other-important-greenhouse-gas\" target=\"_blank\">84 times more potent </a>than carbon dioxide</strong>.</p>\n<p>So, those cows you see plodding peacefully in picturesque pastures could actually be causing quite a bit of harm to our environment.</p>\n<p>Well, not so much those cows. More damaging are their friends who don&#8217;t roam around the fields. When cows are cramped in small stalls, their manure can&#8217;t decompose naturally, so more methane gets released into the atmosphere.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bigstock-Cows-grazing-on-pasture-130384907.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3147\" src=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bigstock-Cows-grazing-on-pasture-130384907.jpg\" alt=\"livestock\" width=\"700\" height=\"514\" srcset=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bigstock-Cows-grazing-on-pasture-130384907.jpg 900w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bigstock-Cows-grazing-on-pasture-130384907-300x220.jpg 300w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bigstock-Cows-grazing-on-pasture-130384907-768x564.jpg 768w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bigstock-Cows-grazing-on-pasture-130384907-610x448.jpg 610w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Challenges farmers face</h2>\n<p>So what&#8217;s a farmer to do?</p>\n<p>Some farmers are opting to <strong>raise</strong> <strong>grass-fed cattle</strong>. That can be a selling point as many of us discover the benefits of choosing <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/whats-the-best-way-to-eat/\">local, grass-fed beef</a> when we really need that burger fix.</p>\n<p>But it takes a lot of land to keep your cows out in the pasture. Farmers may not be able to afford it. And as a planet, we can&#8217;t afford for so much land to be taken up by grazing.</p>\n<p>Other farmers are <strong>investing in methane digesters</strong>. These machines have the advantage of <a href=\"http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Climate-fight-targeting-cows-may-reshape-9401293.php\" target=\"_blank\">generating electricity</a> for the farmers, while cutting methane emissions.</p>\n<p>Still, methane digesters aren&#8217;t cheap. New laws are being passed in some states to regulate methane emissions, so some farmers may choose to make the investment to comply. But others will likely be forced out of business.</p>\n<p>A promising new solution may be a simpler one: <strong>adding seaweed to a cow&#8217;s diet</strong>. Australian researchers are claiming that this addition <a href=\"http://futurism.com/the-key-to-saving-the-environment-seaweed-eating-cows/\" target=\"_blank\">cuts methane emissions by up to 99%</a>! It remains to be seen how we can produce enough seaweed to make a dent on the diet of all the cows around the world.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bigstock-Funny-cow-on-a-green-summer-me-43264438.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3148\" src=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bigstock-Funny-cow-on-a-green-summer-me-43264438.jpg\" alt=\"Funny cow on a green summer meadow\" width=\"700\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bigstock-Funny-cow-on-a-green-summer-me-43264438.jpg 900w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bigstock-Funny-cow-on-a-green-summer-me-43264438-300x199.jpg 300w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bigstock-Funny-cow-on-a-green-summer-me-43264438-768x509.jpg 768w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bigstock-Funny-cow-on-a-green-summer-me-43264438-610x405.jpg 610w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bigstock-Funny-cow-on-a-green-summer-me-43264438-210x140.jpg 210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2>How do we fix this?</h2>\n<p>You and I may not be able to solve the problems of farmers. But we can all have a real impact on methane emissions.</p>\n<p>Something each one of us can all do is to <strong>simply eat less meat and dairy</strong>.</p>\n<p>This idea may not have you jumping up and down for joy. But hear me out.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not saying you should never consume meat or dairy again. A good start is to <strong>cut back a bit</strong>. When you realize that foregoing just one quarter-pound burger <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/a-surprising-way-to-conserve-water/\">saves as much water as skipping 15 showers</a>, you might feel even more motivated. Add to that the health benefits of a plant-based diet, and you might <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/are-you-a-reducitarian/\">consider becoming a reducetarian</a>.</p>\n<h2>You have options</h2>\n<p>This <strong>doesn&#8217;t mean sacrificing taste</strong>. It may not be long till you can even have your cake &#8212; or your burger &#8212; and eat it!</p>\n<p>New laboratory-grown meat coming on the market, like the <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/food/1.743774\" target=\"_blank\">Impossible Burger</a>, may let us <strong>enjoy a real meat flavor without harming our health or the environment</strong>. These burgers are a far cry from the soy- or seed-based substitutes that were our only options till now.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.onegreenplanet.org/vegan-food/best-vegan-cheese-brands/\" target=\"_blank\">Vegan cheeses are also getting better</a>, and becoming more popular.</p>\n<p>So consider your options these days. Consider cutting back on the dairy and meat.</p>\n<p>Your body will thank you. The planet will thank you. And <strong>your bovine buddies will thank you</strong>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bigstock-Silly-smiling-cow-on-sky-backg-14013413.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3146\" src=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bigstock-Silly-smiling-cow-on-sky-backg-14013413.jpg\" alt=\"Silly smiling cow on sky background\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bigstock-Silly-smiling-cow-on-sky-backg-14013413.jpg 900w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bigstock-Silly-smiling-cow-on-sky-backg-14013413-150x150.jpg 150w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bigstock-Silly-smiling-cow-on-sky-backg-14013413-300x300.jpg 300w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bigstock-Silly-smiling-cow-on-sky-backg-14013413-768x768.jpg 768w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bigstock-Silly-smiling-cow-on-sky-backg-14013413-610x610.jpg 610w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bigstock-Silly-smiling-cow-on-sky-backg-14013413-735x735.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<span class=\"rad_rapidology_bottom_trigger\"></span>",

On the one side there are relatively inexpensive, low-range vehicles. On the other, there are expensive Teslas that offer much longer range. Low-cost, high-range models are missing from the market currently. But, that won&#8217;t be the case for long!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Chevrolet-Bolt-concept-201-626x382.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3167 size-full\" src=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Chevrolet-Bolt-concept-201-626x382.jpg\" alt=\"low cost, high range\" width=\"626\" height=\"382\" srcset=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Chevrolet-Bolt-concept-201-626x382.jpg 626w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Chevrolet-Bolt-concept-201-626x382-300x183.jpg 300w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Chevrolet-Bolt-concept-201-626x382-610x372.jpg 610w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Manufacturers are rushing to bring new models to market to fill this void. When the Chevrolet Bolt is released later this year, it&#8217;ll be the first model to hit this low-cost, high-range sweet spot. People will be watching its reception closely, as it could really open up the market for EVs.</p>\n<h2>Looking further ahead</h2>\n<p>Looking at models that will be coming out over the next several years gives us even more reason to smile. Major manufacturers are pushing the limits of range and cost with almost every model announced.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/budd-e_concept_5786.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3169\" src=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/budd-e_concept_5786.jpg\" alt=\"budd-e_concept_5786\" width=\"800\" height=\"422\" srcset=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/budd-e_concept_5786.jpg 800w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/budd-e_concept_5786-300x158.jpg 300w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/budd-e_concept_5786-768x405.jpg 768w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/budd-e_concept_5786-610x322.jpg 610w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p>\n<p>These new model cars look great too!

Are solar customers saddling their non-solar neighbors with extra costs?</p>\n<p><strong>In a word: No.</strong></p>\n<p>It turns out that <strong><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/rooftop-solar-net-metering-is-a-net-benefit/#\" target=\"_blank\">the economic benefits of net metering outweigh the costs</a></strong>. What&#8217;s more, there&#8217;s not even any significant cost increase for non-solar customers.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s the cost of net metering? Well, the utility gets less money from solar customers to cover things like utility infrastructure costs.</p>\n<p>What are the economic benefits? A big one is <strong>savings on infrastructure</strong> (notice a connection to the cost I just mentioned?). When more people put solar their roofs, we don&#8217;t need as many transmission lines or other expensive utility infrastructure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/NoPowerLines.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3143\" src=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/NoPowerLines.png\" alt=\"studies have shown\" width=\"600\" height=\"406\" srcset=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/NoPowerLines.png 1664w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/NoPowerLines-300x203.png 300w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/NoPowerLines-768x520.png 768w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/NoPowerLines-1024x693.png 1024w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/NoPowerLines-610x413.png 610w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Another cost benefit is <strong>savings for utilities on meeting state renewables requirements</strong>. When they get solar from people&#8217;s roofs, the utilities don&#8217;t need to buy clean energy somewhere else.</p>\n<h2>The many benefits of solar</h2>\n<p>But the benefits of solar don&#8217;t end there.

The vast majority of residential solar companies are reputable and will help you save you money. But because solar is catching on so much, there are also a few scammers looking to take advantage of consumers.</p>\n<p>How do you spot them?</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>How solar scams happen</h2>\n<p>The<strong> most common solar scam involves luring you into paying a huge deposit</strong> to a contractor who doesn&#8217;t deliver the system.</p>\n<p>This is really no different from any other home improvement scam &#8212; like when a contractor promises to either “fix” your shingles or deliver an “effective” alarm system. <strong>In the case of solar, the scam artist may take off with your deposit or install a bogus system that doesn&#8217;t work.</strong> Before you know it, the contractor is nowhere to be found and you&#8217;re left with a leaky roof.</p>\n<p>This is no reason to shy away from home solar, though.

Of course not.</p>\n<h2>How to avoid solar scams</h2>\n<p>The biggest thing going for these scammers is homeowners&#8217; lack of information.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, adding a rooftop solar system is more complicated than some home renovations. You probably don&#8217;t want to go out and research all of the ins and outs of how a solar system works &#8212; and that&#8217;s okay.</p>\n<p>But watch for a few<strong> red flags when you&#8217;re talking to a solar salesperson:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>High-pressure sales tactics</li>\n<li>Overselling of the available tax credits</li>\n<li>Nobody actually checking your roof</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Essentially, if a salesperson shows you something that looks too good to be true, it probably is.</p>\n<p>It also helps to shop around a bit. Make sure to <strong>get at least two to three solar quotes from different energy companies.</strong> You can then <a href=\"http://www.mydomino.com/blog/how-to-compare-solar-quotes-in-4-easy-steps/\">compare the quotes</a> to determine your best option.</p>\n<p>Finally, make sure to vet any company you&#8217;re considering by checking online sources like Yelp and the <a href=\"http://www.bbb.org\" target=\"_blank\">Better Business Bureau</a>.</p>\n<h2>What the industry is doing to help</h2>\n<p>Most people who get into the solar industry do it because they want to make a positive impact on the world. People in solar want to ensure that the industry keeps doing the right thing &#8212; and that the public is protected.</p>\n<p>The main industry organization, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), takes this very seriously. SEIA is making <a href=\"http://www.seia.org/policy/consumer-protection\" target=\"_blank\">consumer protection</a> a major part of their work. That includes resources designed to safeguard your rights, a forum where anyone interested can get materials relevant to consumer protection, and guidelines for the solar industry to strengthen consumer protection.</p>\n<p>Reputable solar companies are doing everything they can to stop the scams. After all, they don&#8217;t want to tarnish the industry&#8217;s good reputation.</p>\n<h2>Let MyDomino help</h2>\n<p>If you <a href=\"http://mydomino.com/?utm_source=bff_blog&amp;utm_medium=bff_article&amp;utm_campaign=bff_How_To_Avoid_Scams\" target=\"_blank\">go solar through MyDomino</a>, you can rest assured you won&#8217;t be the target of any solar scams.

Today, Halloween has turned into a multi-billion-dollar holiday that can both be unhealthy and produce tons of waste. It doesn&#8217;t have to be this way. <!--more--></p>\n<p>You can make Halloween more environmentally friendly and a little more healthy for your family.</p>\n<p>Here are 5 easy things you can do to feel good about celebrating the holiday.

Between what&#8217;s already in your closet and a neighborhood thrift store, there&#8217;s tons of great options for costumes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/11059647_10104269017666257_2234920987380668800_o.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-3131\" src=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/11059647_10104269017666257_2234920987380668800_o-168x300.jpg\" alt=\"environmentally friendly Halloween\" width=\"190\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/11059647_10104269017666257_2234920987380668800_o-168x300.jpg 168w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/11059647_10104269017666257_2234920987380668800_o-768x1370.jpg 768w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/11059647_10104269017666257_2234920987380668800_o-574x1024.jpg 574w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/11059647_10104269017666257_2234920987380668800_o-610x1088.jpg 610w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/11059647_10104269017666257_2234920987380668800_o.jpg 1148w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 190px) 100vw, 190px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Even if you don&#8217;t create an entire costume from scratch, you can greatly reduce the amount you buy when using clothes you already have.</p>\n<p>These minion costumes, for example, were mainly created with clothes we already had in our closets. And they look a lot better than anything you can buy!</p>\n<p>Another way to reduce waste with costumes is to re-purpose them. Instead of throwing away your costumes after the holidays are over, hold on to them. Who knows what kind of unique costume you can come up with by mixing and matching what you&#8217;ve already got.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>2: Light your house with LEDs</h2>\n<p>Are you one of those people who goes big with the decorating every Halloween? If so, swap our your mood lighting for LEDs. These days, <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/concierges-change-light-bulb/\">LEDs come in all shapes, sizes, and colors</a> &#8212; so save some energy and money by switching over to them.</p>\n<h2>3: Make some yummy, healthy snacks</h2>\n<p>Everyone loves making jack-o-lanterns. Instead of throwing all the pumpkin &#8220;guts&#8221; out, keep them and toast the seeds for a delicious, healthy snack. You can also compost the fleshy interior to further reduce your waste.</p>\n<h2>4: Go for a walk</h2>\n<p>One of the best parts of Halloween is seeing everyone else&#8217;s amazing costumes. Instead of getting in the car to drive around the neighborhood, grab your LED flashlight and take a walk. Not only will you save money by not burning any gas, you&#8217;ll get you and your kids some exercise and burn off that sugar rush.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3134\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Happy-Hallowween-er.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-3134\" src=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Happy-Hallowween-er-300x251.png\" alt=\"environmentally friendly Halloween\" width=\"600\" height=\"503\" srcset=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Happy-Hallowween-er-300x251.png 300w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Happy-Hallowween-er-768x644.png 768w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Happy-Hallowween-er-610x511.png 610w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Happy-Hallowween-er-310x260.png 310w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Happy-Hallowween-er.png 940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">MyDomino dog Hobbes is ready for his Halloween walk!</p></div>\n<h2>5: Limit the candy intake</h2>\n<p>Speaking of sugar, to keep the holiday happy and healthy, limit how much candy you and your family eat that night.

For giving out candy, consider the above-mentioned healthy treats, or maybe some fair-trade chocolate.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t feel bad for splurging a little</h2>\n<p>Halloween is meant to be a fun holiday for the whole family to enjoy.

A recent survey <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/05/americans-strongly-favor-expanding-solar-power-to-help-address-costs-and-environmental-concerns/\" target=\"_blank\">by the Pew Research Center</a> shows that 89% of all Americans believe that expanding the use of solar is a good idea.<!--more--></p>\n<p>The survey further found that although just 4% of homeowners throughout the country have solar, a full 40% have considered getting it in the last 12 months.</p>\n<h2>There&#8217;s lots to love about solar</h2>\n<p>Solar can help homeowners <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/solar-costs-and-savings/\">save a lot money</a>, but solar has lots of other great benefits as well. For instance, studies have shown that a solar system can actually <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/solar-home-values/\">increase a home&#8217;s value.</a> As people become more knowledgeable about solar, this trend will only continue.</p>\n<p>It may not be apparent, but <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/can-solar-power-help-with-a-historic-drought/\">solar also helps save water</a>. Solar doesn&#8217;t require any water to create electricity. Most conventional power plants use large quantities of water to create steam and spin a turbine to make electricity. On the other hand, solar requires only a small amount of water to manufacture the panels.</p>\n<p>Solar also <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/rise-of-solar-power/\">creates jobs</a>. Solar jobs grew over 20.2% from 2014, 12 times faster than the overall economy. As of November 2015, solar employed <a href=\"http://www.thesolarfoundation.org/national/\" target=\"_blank\">208,859 workers</a> &#8212; and this number has grown since then. That&#8217;s more than the coal and natural gas industries combined!</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to learn even more great things about solar power, check out our <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/10-things-we-love-about-solar/\">blog post on some of the top things we love about it.</a></p>\n<h2>Where people love solar the most</h2>\n<p>It turns out solar&#8217;s popularity isn&#8217;t evenly distributed throughout the country.</p>\n<p>The Pew survey shows that solar is more popular in the western half of the country. In the west, 52% of people have considered going solar, and 14% already have a solar system on their home. In the east, only 2% of respondents have solar, and 37% have seriously considered switching to it.</p>\n<p>California specifically is leading the country in rooftop solar, making up 40% of the market. Other big states include Arizona, which is ranked 3rd, and Hawaii, at number 6.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that this is just a survey, and these numbers may not be completely accurate throughout the overall population.</p>\n<h2>Do you love solar?</h2>\n<p>What are your thoughts about solar? We&#8217;d love to hear what you think in the comments section below.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious to learn more about solar, and how it could benefit you, contact a <a href=\"http://mydomino.com/?utm_source=bff_blog&amp;utm_medium=bff_article&amp;utm_campaign=bff_AmericansLoveSolar\" target=\"_blank\">MyDomino energy savings concierge.</a> Your concierge will help you see if solar makes sense for you and your family.

      "rendered": "<p>So you&#8217;re going solar. You&#8217;re excited about generating free energy from the sun &#8212; as you should be!</p>\n<p>But <strong>is your solar installer telling you everything you need to know</strong>? To make your experience as good as possible, here are a few things you should know.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>1. Your solar system won&#8217;t generate power all the time</h2>\n<p>You may already realize that solar won&#8217;t work at night &#8212; after all, there&#8217;s no sun shining on your panels then.</p>\n<p>But did you know that your panels won&#8217;t generate power at dawn or at dusk ? In fact, depending on where you live, you might get 5 &#8211; 8 hours of good solar power production each day.</p>\n<p>This image shows the average number of sunny hours a day in June, for different parts of the country:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.beyondfossilfuels.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/average-radiation-june.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1569 size-full\" src=\"http://www.beyondfossilfuels.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/average-radiation-june.jpg\" alt=\"average-radiation-june\" width=\"600\" height=\"391\" srcset=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/average-radiation-june.jpg 600w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/average-radiation-june-300x196.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The good news is that when you are generating power, you probably won&#8217;t need it all. The power you don&#8217;t need goes back to the grid. You get a credit for that power that you can use later, when your system is not generating power. This is known as <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/how-solar-net-metering-works/\"><strong>net metering</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Your solar installer will size your system so that it generates enough power for a good percentage of your overall energy needs.</p>\n<p>You should also know that your system won&#8217;t generate energy when the power goes out. For safety reasons, solar systems are made to shut off at those times. If your system is connected to a battery backup, you may be able to generate a small amount of power to run essentials like your refrigerator.</p>\n<h2>2. Not everything is covered by your solar installer</h2>\n<p>Your solar installer may tell you that you&#8217;re covered for any roof leaks caused by your solar system. That&#8217;s true. It&#8217;s important to be aware, however, that to be covered, leaks must really be caused by the solar installation. In most cases, that means they must be within 3 inches of any solar system roof penetrations.</p>\n<p>Solar panels last a long time. But the power they generate (DC) has to be converted into power your home can use (AC). That&#8217;s done by the inverter, which doesn&#8217;t last as long as the panels. Most inverters must be replaced after about 10 years &#8212; and guess how long the warranties last? So be prepared to replace the inverter around that time. Don&#8217;t worry! Inverters are a small expense compared to the whole system, so this will run you maybe a few thousand dollars. If your inverter needs replacing before then, of course, it will be covered. And I&#8217;ve seen them last longer sometimes.</p>\n<h2>3. You need a solid internet connection to monitor your system</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.beyondfossilfuels.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/solarmonitoring.png\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-1581\" src=\"http://www.beyondfossilfuels.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/solarmonitoring-170x300.png\" alt=\"solarmonitoring\" width=\"220\" height=\"387\" srcset=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/solarmonitoring-170x300.png 170w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/solarmonitoring.png 367w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px\" /></a>It&#8217;s important to know how your panels are functioning &#8212; plus, it&#8217;s just fun to keep track of your energy production. What your solar installer might not tell you, though, is that this requires a solid, uninterrupted internet connection. That means, for one, that you&#8217;ll want to keep your router on all the time if you want 24/7 monitoring.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also important for the inverter to be close enough to your router to pick up the signal. In some cases, it may be possible to hardwire your system to your router. Check with your solar installer to see if this will work for you.</p>\n<p>If your internet connection is interrupted, a technician from the solar company may have to come out and reset the monitoring system.</p>\n<p>A great option to ensure your system is monitored round the clock is to choose a company that does the monitoring for you. Since they have production guarantees, it&#8217;s in their best interest to ensure that your system produces as much as possible.

      "rendered": "<p dir=\"ltr\">“What?” you say — “I didn’t know a solar revolution was happening!” Well, 10 years ago would you have imagined getting rid of your land line? Or connecting with friends and businesses over Facebook and Twitter? Much like the way we communicate has changed, the way we get our energy is due for a big change too.<!--more--></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are just a few ways you can be part of the solar revolution — whether or not you own your home. Pick one, sample two, or try all four!</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1. Put solar on your roof</strong></h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you own your home, <strong>the best way to join the solar revolution is to put solar on your roof.</strong> More people than ever are going solar. And most solar installations are happening in <a href=\"http://mydomino.com/blog/solar-is-so-middle-class/\">middle-class neighborhoods</a>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Why are some calling this the <a href=\"http://rooftoprevolution.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rooftop Revolution</a>? Solar is spreading fast for a few reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/cheap-solar-power-now/\">cost of solar has plummeted</a>. While conventional power prices keep going up, <a href=\"http://pvsolarreport.com/blog/item/951-ost-pv-cells-solar-power-grid-parity\">solar is 99% cheaper</a> than it was in 1977.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://mydomino.com/blog/lease-ppa-or-buy-oh-my/\">Financing options like leases</a> and <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/how-do-solar-loans-work/\">solar loans</a> let you go solar with no money down and start saving on Day 1.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Solar lets you <a href=\"http://mydomino.com/blog/happy-energy-independence-day/\">take charge of your own power</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wondering if solar is right for you? Now, it’s quick, easy, and simple to find out. Just <a href=\"http://mydomino.com/?utm_source=bff_blog&amp;utm_medium=bff_article&amp;utm_campaign=bff_solar_revolution\" target=\"_blank\">contact a MyDomino energy savings concierge</a>. We’ll help you through the whole process so you can choose what’s right for your family.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">2. Sign up for community solar</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re like many Americans, you may not be able to put solar panels on your own roof. Over <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/cant-go-solar/\">75% of us</a> either rent, have a shaded roof, or don’t qualify for some other reason.</p>\n<p>But don’t worry! In many states, you can still get the energy freedom and savings that come with solar power — without putting any panels on your roof. You can do that with offsite solar, often known as shared solar or <strong><a href=\"http://mydomino.com/blog/cant-put-solar-panels-on-your-roof/\">community solar</a></strong>.<span id=\"more-146\"></span></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Solar panels are installed at another site, usually near where you live.</li>\n<li>You buy or subscribe to some of the solar panels that are installed at that site, and you use the power they generate for your home.</li>\n<li>You get a credit on your electricity bill for the power produced by your solar panels.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://mydomino.com/?utm_source=bff_blog&amp;utm_medium=bff_article&amp;utm_campaign=bff_solar_revolution\" target=\"_blank\">Contact a MyDomino energy savings concierge </a>to see if community solar is available in your area. These days, there are even new community solar programs <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/solar-savings-with-portable-panels/\">available nationwide</a>.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3. Invest in a solar project and get a good return</strong></h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you can’t go solar or participate in community solar — or if you can, but don’t want to stop there — investing in a solar project might be just the thing for you.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is not the same as investing in a company’s stock. When you invest in a business, you can’t know how successful it will be. And the stock market is mysterious and volatile. <a href=\"http://mydomino.com/blog/5-reasons-solar-is-safe-investment/\">Investing in a solar project is safer</a>, and returns are pretty good, around 4.5 – 7%.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">More companies are offering these investing opportunities. <a href=\"https://www.collectivesun.com/investors\" target=\"_blank\">Collective Sun</a> lets you invest in solar projects for nonprofits, with as little as $25. <a href=\"http://sunfunder.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SunFunder</a> lets accredited investors fund high-impact solar projects in off-grid communities around the world.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you do want to invest in a business, <a href=\"https://www.cuttingedgecapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cutting Edge Capital</a> provides a way for anyone to invest in local businesses, including solar companies.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4. Donate or volunteer for solar</strong></h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If that&#8217;s still not enough solar for you, you can donate to groups like these or volunteer your time — which is a fun way to help while learning more about solar power:</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.gridalternatives.org/\" target=\"_blank\">GRID Alternatives</a>: Provides solar systems to low-income homeowners and on-the-job solar training.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.re-volv.org/\" target=\"_blank\">RE-volv</a>: Uses a revolving fund that keeps growing to put solar on community centers.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.everybodysolar.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Everybody Solar</a>: Helps nonprofits go solar so they can spend more of their funds serving their communities.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://sunwork.org/\" target=\"_blank\">SunWork</a>: Installs solar on small-energy-footprint homes with the help of trained volunteers.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The great thing about helping out solar nonprofits is that this option is available to everyone — wherever you live, and whatever you can afford.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Image: Union of Concerned Scientists</em></p>\n<span class=\"rad_rapidology_bottom_trigger\"></span>",

      "rendered": "<p>Updated 10/13/16</p>\n<p>Did you know that heating is the largest home energy bill for most Americans? Or that it produces more carbon emissions than any other residential activity?</p>\n<p>With winter fast approaching, it might be time to rethink how you heat your home.<!--more--></p>\n<h2>Upgrading to a heat pump</h2>\n<p>This is a great time to <strong>consider a <a href=\"http://mydomino.com/blog/what-the-heck-is-a-heat-pump/\">modern heat pump</a></strong>. The beauty of this device is that it acts as both your heater and your air conditioner.</p>\n<p>As if that weren&#8217;t enough, <strong>a heat pump is also more efficient than a traditional furnace</strong>. That’s because it doesn’t actually create heat — it just moves heat around. To cool your home, it moves heat from inside your home to the outside. To heat your home, it does the opposite and moves heat into your home.</p>\n<p>With a heat pump, your home is also likely to be more comfortable, because it will be heated and cooled more evenly. And a heat pump can last over 25 years, so you won’t need to worry about replacing it anytime soon.</p>\n<p>Given all the benefits of heat pumps, it&#8217;s not surprising that their sales have risen dramatically in recent years. In Europe, the heat pump market <a href=\"http://www.sunwindenergy.com/heat-pumps/heat-pumps-rise\" target=\"_blank\">grew by 10% just in 2015</a>. From 2012 to 2014, heat pump sales <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/10/05/new-heat-pump-technology-can-warm-homes-even-cold-new-england-winters/JgABf7wNFqRcYI6YVN6nsI/story.html\" target=\"_blank\">increased by 30%</a> in the U.S.</p>\n<h2>Why we need heat pumps</h2>\n<p>Solar power and electric cars are great! They&#8217;ll go a long way toward helping us get off dirty fossil fuels and onto clean, renewable energy.</p>\n<p>But we can&#8217;t get all the way there if we don&#8217;t <strong>change how we heat our homes</strong>.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not a matter of waiting for some new, futuristic technology to come along and save us. We have the tools we need already &#8212; and the heat pump is an important one. As energy journalist David Roberts <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/10/5/13165262/heat-pumps-boring-but-important\" target=\"_blank\">pointed out recently</a>, it will take this kind of &#8220;unsexy&#8221; technology to get us all the way to 100% clean energy.</p>\n<h2>Two kinds of heat pumps</h2>\n<p>So now you&#8217;re convinced that heat pumps are the way to go. But there&#8217;s one more thing to consider. You can choose between these two kinds of heat pumps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Air-source:</strong> Moves heat through the air. The unit is similar to a central air conditioner and can even be the same piece of equipment.</li>\n<li><strong>Geothermal:</strong> Moves heat to and from the ground. Requires drilling into the ground to install.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both kinds are popular. As many as 50,000 American homes are switching to geothermal each year, and <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/air-source-heat-pumps-gaining-traction/\">air-source heat pumps are starting to gain on them</a>.</p>\n<h2>Comparing your options</h2>\n<p>Which heat pump is right for you? That depends how much you&#8217;re comfortable spending upfront, whether you&#8217;re okay with having a hole drilled on your property, and what climate you live in. Here&#8217;s a quick reference to compare your options:</p>\n<table border=\"1\" width=\"672\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th valign=\"top\">Geothermal</th>\n<th valign=\"top\">Air-Source</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Pros</strong></td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<ul>\n<li>Even more efficient than an air-source heat pump, and works well in very cold climates.</li>\n<li>Qualifies for 30% tax credit.</li>\n<li>Can save you up to 70% on your energy bill each month.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<ul>\n<li>More efficient than traditional AC and furnace.</li>\n<li>Much cheaper than a geothermal heat pump.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Cons</strong></td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<ul>\n<li>Much more expensive than an air-source heat pump.</li>\n<li>Involves some drilling into the ground.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<ul>\n<li>More expensive than a traditional furnace.</li>\n<li>Less efficient than geothermal.</li>\n<li>May not work as well in extremely cold climates, where you may even need a backup heat source.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As you can see, <strong>both types of heat pump are more efficient than a traditional furnace</strong>. And you&#8217;ll save money and energy with both. If you power either one with solar, you&#8217;ll save even more.</p>\n<h2>Making the choice</h2>\n<p>Now that you have an idea of the pros and cons of each kind of heat pump, you can decide which is right for you. And you can get more details by talking with a <a href=\"http://mydomino.com/?utm_source=bff_blog&amp;utm_medium=bff_article&amp;utm_campaign=bff_best_way_to_heat_cool\">MyDomino energy savings concierge</a>.
