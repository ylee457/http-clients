Thanks to you, we&#8217;ve been able to help create thousands of clean energy actions!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some of you hadn&#8217;t thought much about clean energy before talking to a MyDomino concierge. Others had been wanting to make the switch for years, but hadn&#8217;t realized how easy it can be.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But all of you have one thing in common. You all want to be part of making a positive impact on our world &#8212; for all of us, and for future generations!</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">2. Our amazing team</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We&#8217;re so thankful to have such a wonderful team to work with at MyDomino! From our congenial and knowledgeable energy savings concierges to our diligent and creative development team to our inquisitive and resourceful product analyst &#8212; and everyone else on the team &#8212; <strong>we all come to work every day excited to be making a difference</strong>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It&#8217;s more than just our meaningful work that keeps us going. Having such a great team to work with makes the days fly by!</p>\n<h2>3. Cheaper and more accessible solar power</h2>\n<p>Did you know that solar power is over <a href=\"https://blog.mydomino.com/cheap-solar-power-now/\">50% cheaper now than it was in 2009</a>? The priced has dropped <strong>faster than a sack of frozen turkeys dropped out of an airplane</strong>! And that means that solar is becoming accessible to more and more people.</p>\n<p>In fact, solar is spreading the most in <a href=\"https://blog.mydomino.com/solar-is-so-middle-class/\">middle-class neighborhoods</a>. <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2015/07/11/solar-power-for-low-moderate-income-americans-obamas-new-solar-initiative/\" target=\"_blank\">Lower-income folks</a> are also getting in on the solar action. Plus, <a href=\"https://blog.mydomino.com/solar-savings-with-portable-panels/\">community solar programs</a> are making solar possible even for people who can&#8217;t put panels on their own roof.</p>\n<p>Solar really is for everyone. That&#8217;s something to be thankful for.</p>\n<h2>4. Clean power plans that let anyone make the switch</h2>\n<p>If for some reason you can&#8217;t go solar, or if your solar panels don&#8217;t cover all your energy use, you can still use clean energy!</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re super thankful for new <a href=\"https://blog.mydomino.com/clean-power-plan-for-everyone/\">clean power options</a> that let anyone with a power bill switch to clean wind energy. Renters and homeowners alike can sign up for a clean power plan and support more clean energy coming onto our electric grid &#8212; instead of power that may come from dirty fossil fuels.</p>\n<p><strong>Let&#8217;s talk turkey</strong>: The truth is, these days just about anyone can switch to clean power &#8212; even if you rent!</p>\n<h2>5. Better and more affordable electric cars</h2>\n<p>You can already <a href=\"https://blog.mydomino.com/ride-electric\">save money with an electric car</a>. The most popular electric car out there now, the Nissan Leaf, will run you less than $22,000 after tax credits — well below the average $32,000 sticker price for gas-powered cars.</p>\n<p>You’ll also save money on fuel (especially if you <a href=\"https://blog.mydomino.com/solar-101/\">power your car with solar</a>), maintenance, and insurance for your car.</p>\n<p>If that&#8217;s not good enough for you, the new models coming out soon will have <a href=\"https://blog.mydomino.com/new-electric-cars-coming-market/\">much better range and a lower price tag</a>!</p>\n<p>So maybe it&#8217;s time to consider <strong>driving to that Thanksgiving feast in a clean new ride</strong>.</p>\n<h2> 6. Fresh and healthy food options</h2>\n<p>Speaking of Thanksgiving feasts, we&#8217;re so thankful that these days, you can eat right by the planet and still enjoy your meal.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been following our blog, you may already know how much you can help the environment by making <a href=\"https://blog.mydomino.com/cows-climate-change/\">small changes to your diet</a>. <strong>You don&#8217;t have to go cold turkey</strong> &#8212; consider becoming a <a href=\"https://blog.mydomino.com/are-you-a-reducitarian/\">reducetarian</a>. The good news is, it&#8217;s easy to do!</p>\n<p>Avoiding processed foods and foods from factory farms will make your Thanksgiving feast more tasty &#8212; and better for you and the planet. The same goes for choosing <a href=\"https://blog.mydomino.com/lets-start-eating-local/\">locally grown fruits and vegetables</a>.

Simple actions with epic effects</h2>\n<p>Our list wouldn&#8217;t be complete with <strong>one of the top things we&#8217;re thankful for every day</strong>: How easily we can all make a difference!</p>\n<p>Think replacing a light bulb is just a drop in the bucket? It is! But if 60 people switch to LEDs, that’s like taking <a href=\"https://blog.mydomino.com/small-light-bulb-epic-effect/\">25 cars off the road for a year</a>. If 1000 people switch, that&#8217;s like taking over 400 cars off the road. If every American household made the switch, it would be like taking nearly 52 million cars off the road for a whole year! That&#8217;s about one-fifth of all cars on American roads.</p>\n<p>You get the picture.</p>\n<p>Each one of us can do so many small things that will lead to epic effects &#8212; for the world, and for our pocketbooks.
